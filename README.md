# todotask

Hello everyOne

I'm happy to tell you about the successfully task.

My task was Todo application using ( Bloc stateManagement and NoSql LocalStorage ).

I made the todo contain three fields(id,title,description and stateOfTask(complete or pending))ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
I could add other fields such as (Date of todo), but i thought this enoughðŸ˜Š
If you want to add some thing please send me , my contact information is the end of the file ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

Where user can add,update and delete todo && can make the todo complete and pending
But(When user click on todo => I sent the date about constructor (Mean i didn't use the method for
get specific todo , because i want do new something in task but if you want to get one todo i am
ready please send me ) )

When user update or pending the todo => i want to click on button for (pending or complete in
AddUpdatePage)

Also i made update and add todo in one page (i sent parameter in constructor to choose add or update
page ) => i did not create 2 page (Add And Update todo ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š)

Also i didn't realtime the page when (add or update or delete the task) the different will show when
refresh the page After update, add and delete the todo  (because i want do new something in task (
Refresh page ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š))

I used to do this task :

Clean architecture code (The role 5 by Ankle Bob ) (data,domain and presentation) - Hive for storage
the todo list(NoSql)

Bloc stateManagement (event & state)

Dependency injection using third_party_libraries (GetIt).

Responsive for multi platform (Mobile (android & ios) - Desktop - Web)

Show some beautiful notification for user (Package : flutter toast).

Used abstraction connecting between layer and other layer

third-party-libraries such as : (Bloc | Hive | GetIt | screenUtil | flutterToast | dartz |
pathProvider)

I used Uuid package for generate hard id for every new todo
